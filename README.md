# Healthcare AI Datasheet

## Overview

This repository contains the Healthcare AI Datasheet, a tool developed to help improve transparency, accountability, and ethics in AI models, specifically for healthcare applications. The datasheet is structured and machine-readable, making it easier to document things like potential biases, data sources, and whether the data complies with regulations like GDPR. This helps developers and researchers reduce risks when using AI.

The datasheet is designed to flag potential risks early on, such as biases or issues with data quality, which can lead to unfair healthcare outcomes. By using this datasheet, developers can ensure their AI models are built with ethical practices in mind, aiming to create more fair and inclusive healthcare systems.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation fields covering data sources, bias mitigation strategies, demographic representation, and data collection methods.
- **Machine-Readable Format**: The datasheet is available in JSON format, making it easy to integrate into automated workflows for AI model development and validation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designed to align with GDPR and other relevant regulations, ensuring that AI models respect data privacy and legal obligations.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Includes specific sections for documenting potential biases and strategies to mitigate them, making the AI development process more transparent and equitable.
