# Healthcare AI Datasheet

## Overview

This repository contains the **Healthcare AI Datasheet**, a comprehensive framework designed to improve the transparency, accountability, and ethical standards in AI model development, particularly in healthcare applications. The datasheet provides a structured and machine-readable documentation format to highlight potential biases, data sources, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), helping developers and researchers mitigate risks in AI deployment.

The **Healthcare AI Datasheet** supports early identification of potential risks, including bias and data quality issues, which can disproportionately affect healthcare outcomes. By adopting this datasheet, developers and researchers can ensure that their AI models are built on a strong foundation of ethical considerations, helping to foster fair and equitable healthcare solutions.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation fields covering data sources, bias mitigation strategies, demographic representation, and data collection methods.
- **Machine-Readable Format**: The datasheet is available in JSON format, making it easy to integrate into automated workflows for AI model development and validation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designed to align with GDPR and other relevant regulations, ensuring that AI models respect data privacy and legal obligations.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Includes specific sections for documenting potential biases and strategies to mitigate them, making the AI development process more transparent and equitable.
